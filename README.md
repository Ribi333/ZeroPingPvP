# ZeroPingPvP

ALWAYS TEST ON A ALT YOU DO NOT CARE ABOUT BEFORE USING ON YOUR MAIN

This is mostly safe but sometimes can be detected if the code is messed up even by one line and sends too many packets accidentally.

Uses C02PacketUseEntity packet to make PvP feel instant by simulating hits client-side.
Use /zppvp to see commands

Uses C02PacketUseEntity to detect when the client sends an attack packet then simulates the hit client-sided.
Helps with high ping players on Hypixel or any PvP server.
